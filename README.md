# microcontroller
char
unsigned char size: 8 bit range: 0 to 255 \
signed char size: 8 bit range: -128 to 127 \

int \
unsigned short int size: 8 bit range: 0 to 255 \
unsigned int size: 16 bit range: 0 to 2^16 \
unsigned long int size: 32 bit range: 0 to 2^32 \
signed short int size: 8 bit range: -128 to 127 \
signed int size: 16 bit range: 2^15 to 2^15-1 \
signed long int size: 32 bit range: 2^31 to 2^31-1 \

Array \ 

we can create array all emenent same like this: \

signed int Array_Name[Len_of_Array]  \
first index of array is equal to 0 \

#Pointers \

pointers hold the memory adress of variable \

#Struct \

struct same as Python class \

struct StructName{ \
  unsigned char VariableNameOfChar; \
  unsigned int variableNameOfInt; \
  . \
  . \
  . \
} \
